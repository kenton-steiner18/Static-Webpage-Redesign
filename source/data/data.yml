directions:
  - header: "Directions to My Office"
  - north: "Take any major highway to I-270. Take I-270 to SR 315 south.
   From SR 315 south, exit at Lane Avenue."
  - south: "Take any major highway to I-71 north. Take I-71 north to SR 315
   north. Exit at Lane Avenue."
  - west: "Take any major highway to I-70 east. Take I-70 east to SR 315 north.
   Exit at Lane Avenue."
  - east: "Take any major highway to I-70 west. Take I-70 west to SR 315 north.
   Exit at Lane Avenue."
  - airport: "Take I-670 west to I-71 south. Take I-71 south to I-70 west.
   Take I-70 west to SR 315 north. Exit at Lane Avenue."
  - detailed_directions: "Take Lane Avenue (going east into OSU) over the
   bridge until you reach Tuttle Park Place road. Take a right onto Tuttle
   Park Place road and continue down (shortly) through the big 4-way
   intersection (intersecting with Woody Hayes Dr.). Shortly after the
   intersection you will see a large parking garage on your left (with an
   immediate entrance into the garage from the road). The OSU Stadium will
   be directly on your right. Enter this garage and take the ticket to park
   your car (we will give you a pass later to exit the garage at no charge).
   I am located in office 491 Dreese Labs, directly adjacent (behind) to
   the parking garage. It is the tallest red brick building in the immediate
   area. It also has a characteristic white spool on the very top of the
    building."

  - title: "Video Surveillance"
  - img: "video_surveillance.jpg"
  - text: "Prof. Jim Davis, Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering,
   is developing advanced video surveillance systems that use computers
    equipped with video cameras to not only detect the presence of people
     and track them, but also to identify their activities. The research
      has broad implications for Homeland Security as well as search and
       rescue, border patrol, law enforcement and many other types of
        military applications. The systems combine video cameras with machine
         learning methods, enabling the computer to perform the kind of visual
          recognition that seems effortless for humans. Davis' work in
           investigating computer vision methods was recognized by the
            National Science Foundation with the prestigious NSF Faculty
             Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award. Support for
              this research (past and present) has been provided by the National
               Science Foundation, U.S. Air Force, Los Alamos National Lab, U.S.
                Army Night Vision Laboratory, Intel, and Ohio Board of Regents."
